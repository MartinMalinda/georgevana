            <p>I used to be a translator and a marketing guy. Even though I wasn't making much and I worked from dawn to dusk, I was glad to be working. It was a bad time but some other people were worse off than me. It was these very jobs that made me thinking about requalification in the first place. One day I was on my break and I was just hanging out. Suddenly I found Green Fox Academy...</p>
            <p>Who was able to identify notions of The Mafia game intro, I applaud you. You must be a gamer and a fan, like me. Besides games, I enjoy driving my 2002 Mazda Miata, good book and good music. But these things gonna have to wait. I have a C# to learn.</p>
